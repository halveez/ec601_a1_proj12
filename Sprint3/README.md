# EC601 Team 12 Project - Sprint 3
Zachary Halvorson, Boston University Fall 2021

## Sprint 3 Results

Implement a shadow detection and elimination method that utilizes the multispectral data.

Automated batch testing for additional sets of images from provided dataset


## Multispectral Shadow Removal Results

### [Based on ALGORITHM X FOUND HERE](https://www.google.com/)

## Sprint 3 Plant Health Results

Normalized Difference Vegetation Index = (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)


## Sprint 4 Plans:

Determine if image alignment pre-processing step is necessary as the multispectral images do not overlap perfectly.

Work on enhanced data output and processing based on pre-cropped regions or detecting crop bounding boxes automatically.
