# EC601 Team 12 Project - Sprint 3
Zachary Halvorson, Boston University Fall 2021

## Sprint 3 To Do List - CHANGE TO "RESULTS" FOR PRESENTATION:

Implement a shadow detection and elimination method that utilizes the multispectral data.

Create additional prompts to allow user to crop image regions based on target areas (ignore grass for instance)

Test additional sets of images form provided dataset - automate batch testing

Add in rectangle detection based on the plots, auto averaging and labeling on the images - color code / overlay the NDVI values over each of the regions in the input NIR or RED image (possibly on the RGB image)


## Multispectral Shadow Removal Results

### [Based on ALGORITHM X FOUND HERE](https://www.google.com/)

## Sprint 3 Plant Health Results

Normalized Difference Vegetation Index = (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)


IMAGE RESULTS HERE FOR NDVI ON CROPPED REGIONS, BOUNDED BOX, MAPPED EXPORT

## Sprint 4 Plans:

Determine if image alignment pre-processing step is necessary as the multispectral images do not overlap perfectly.
